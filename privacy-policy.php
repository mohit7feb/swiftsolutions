This Privacy Policy aims to clarify the information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect it. It also explains your rights concerning the use, access, and amendment of your personal data.</p><br>

<h5>Information Collection Practices</h5>
<p class="justify-text"><b>Website Visits</b></p><br>
<p class="justify-text">When you browse our site, we do not collect any personal data simply by virtue of your visit. To enhance your experience, we automatically gather and store statistical data related to site traffic and usage from our server logs. This data may include the visitor's domain, IP address, browser type, operating system, internet service provider, duration of visit, pages accessed, and clickstream patterns. This aggregated information is anonymous and is used solely to improve your interaction with our website. We only attempt to identify users if there is a suspicion of unlawful activity.</p><br>

<p class="justify-text"><b>Product Purchases</b></p><br>
<p class="justify-text">Our website is designed for showcasing and selling our products, including gifts, home d√©cor, and personalized items. Therefore, during the checkout process, you may be required to provide personal details such as your name, email address, shipping address, and phone number. Additionally, if you proceed with a purchase, we may request further information, including payment details and billing address.</p><br>

<p class="justify-text"><b>Mobile Applications</b></p><br>
<p class="justify-text">When you download and utilize our mobile application, we collect automatic data regarding your device type, performance metrics, and operating system. We implement mobile analytics tools to gain insights into the functionality of our app. This software may track metrics like usage frequency, events occurring within the app, aggregated performance data, and the app's download source. Importantly, we do not associate the information collected through our analytics with any personally identifiable information submitted via the app.</p><br>

        
<p class="justify-text">Occasionally, we may send you push notifications to keep you informed about upcoming events, promotions, or the launch of new products. If you prefer not to receive these notifications, you can disable them at the device settings level.</p><br>

<p class="justify-text"><b>Tracking and Analytics Tools</b></p><br>
<p class="justify-text"><?php echo $companyname ?> utilizes various technologies, including cookies, web beacons, tags, and scripts.
